## Introduction

This project is a graphical application to perform conversions between different representations (binary, decimal, hexadecimal, octal, two's complement) developed with .NET and MAUI. The app has a basic and intuitive user management system that allows registration, login, password recovery and shows the history of operations.

## Project Description

### Main functionalities

- The User class represents the users with their attributes and executed operations.
- The Conversion class defines the interface for the different conversion types.
- Converter acts as a manager that provides the available operations and executes them.
- The GUI has pages for Login, Registration, Recovery, Converter and Operations, which interact with the logic classes.

---

## Application Flow

1. The user starts on the login page.  
2. you can access registration or recovery if necessary.  
3. After logging in, you access the Converter page, where you enters a value and selects the conversion.  
4. The result appears in the same input box.  
5. Each operation is saved in the history linked to the user.  
6. The user can navigate to the Operations page to view his information and the complete history.  
7. The user can logout or exit from the Operations page.

## Problems Encountered

- Real-time history management presented difficulties due to continuous reading and writing of CSV files.  
- Initial problems with paths in Shell navigation and dynamic page loading.
- Coordination between the graphical interface and the logic so that the result is displayed in the same text box. Easily solved after code analysis.
- Many problems with maui installation and configuration.
- Keeping the user session active during the flow of the program, having the users already created even if the user closes the app, and handling the logout correctly required spending time to organize the csv files and the logic.
